# Chrome-Extension-FocusMode

A small and simple interactive tool for customising web pages. You decide what to hide by clicking on highlighted element as you move mouse pointer over the page. It's an essential tool when you need to clean up a web page before printing or taking a screenshot. It can help you to focus on important content by removing distractors.

How to use:
- Install the extension
- Activate the extension (click its icon) when you wish to make some changes 
- Move your mouse to the element you wish to hide
- Click on selected element and watch it disappear
- Deactivate the extension (click its icon again) to continue normal browsing

The extension is free and open-source. It does not collect any information and does not interact with internet. It is not active while you are surfing and does not consume any resources. It only modifies the css styles of selected elements when you use it and then unloads. It was inspired by a same-name Google example.
