# Customize any web page for your needs in a few clicks!

A handy tool for customising web pages. You decide what to hide by clicking on highlighted element as you move mouse pointer over the page. Unlike other focus mode extensions, this tool is not limited to one web site only. Now any web page can look like you want it!

A few examples of use cases:
- clean up a flashy or cluttered UI and keep only important content on your screen
- clean up a web page before printing or taking a screenshot
- unhide content behind blocking dialogs
- remove distractors (ads, autoplay videos, annoying popups, huge headers and banners, etc.)

How to use:
- Install the extension
- Activate the extension (click its icon) when you wish to adjust a web page
- Move your mouse to the element you wish to hide
- Click on selected element and watch it disappear
- Deactivate the extension (click its icon again) to continue normal browsing

A few facts about the tool:
- It is small and simple, free and open-source
- It does not collect any information and does not interact with internet
- It is not active while you are surfing and does not consume any resources unlike adblockers
- It was inspired by a same-name Google example

Because of the static linking in the manifest, the Chrome Web Store will display a security warning. However, this method has proven to be the most efficient and reliable way to give the user full control over the content of any website.
